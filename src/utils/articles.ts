    content: `What is Prenatal care? Prenatal care is when you get checkups from a doctor, nurse, or midwife throughout your pregnancy. It helps keep you and your future baby healthy. Why is it important? Prenatal care is an important part of staying healthy during pregnancy. Your doctor, nurse, or midwife will monitor your future baby’s development and do routine testing to help find and prevent possible problems. These regular checkups are also a great time to learn how to ease any discomfort you may be having, and ask any other questions about your pregnancy and the birth of your future baby. Can things go wrong without prenatal care? Each year, reports of approximately 500 women who died as a result of a pregnancy-related complication.  In 1999, on average there were seven infant deaths per 1000 live births. The leading causes of infant death were congenital anomalies and low birthweight, two conditions that can be considerably impacted by prenatal care. In order to have the best possible outcome for mother and child, early prenatal care is essential. Even before a woman conceives, she can be given folic acid, checked for immunity to rubella and blood type, as well as advised about smoking, drinking alcohol, and eating a healthy diet. Once a woman is pregnant, prenatal visits to a healthcare provider will include examinations to determine the health of the mother and developing the fetus. Am I at risk? A higher risk of death related to pregnancy has been found in women over 35 years of age, women who have borne five or more children, women who did not receive prenatal care, and Hispanic and black women. The single most important factor influencing neonatal mortality is birth weight. The rate of infant death increases significantly with decreasing birth weight for infants weighing less than 2500 grams. Can It Be Prevented? Some estimate that up to one-half of pregnancy-related deaths could be prevented. An important element for decreasing infant mortality is to prevent low birth weight. Early prenatal care can provide necessary information to the mother and effect changes for nutrition-related and behavioural risk factors impacting the mother and baby. What can be done? Consider a preconception visit before you get pregnant. Start taking folic acid before conception. Get early prenatal care. Eat a well-balanced diet. With doctor’s approval, get regular exercise. Limit caffeine and avoid alcohol, cigarettes, and street drugs. What are the most common maternal infections? UTIs, skin and respiratory tract infections are usually not serious problems during pregnancy, although some genital infections (bacterial vaginosis and genital herpes) affect labour or choice of delivery method. However, certain maternal infections can damage the fetus, as may occur in the following: Congenital cytomegalovirus infection Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection Congenital rubella Congenital toxoplasmosis Neonatal hepatitis B Congenital syphilis HIV infection can be transmitted from mother to child transplacentally or perinatally. When the mother is not treated, the risk of transmission at birth is about 25 to 35%. Listeriosis is more common during pregnancy. Listeriosis increases the risk of; Spontaneous abortion, Preterm labour, Stillbirth, Neonatal transmission of listeriosis is possible. Bacterial vaginosis and possibly genital chlamydial infection predispose to Premature rupture of the membranes, Preterm labour. Antibacterials and Pregnancy Antibiotics are commonly prescribed during pregnancy, only prescribed carefully because some antibiotics are harmful to the fetus while others are not. Penicillins, (including amoxicillin, ampicillin), Cephalosporins, (including cefaclor, cephalexin), Erythromycin and Clindamycin. Certain other antibiotics are believed to pose risks during pregnancy. For example, tetracyclines can discolour developing baby’s teeth. Tetracyclines aren’t recommended for use after the 15th week of pregnancy. If an antibiotic is the best way to treat your condition, your health care provider will prescribe the safest antibiotic at the safest dosage.`

    region: "Africa",
    content: `Am I carrying Twins? When you realize that you are carrying twins, you might be surprised, excited and even be in denial. A twin pregnancy is more complicated than a single pregnancy, so you’ll need more visits to health professionals and more tests and checks during your pregnancy. When am I likely to get pregnant with Twins? You are more likely to become pregnant with twins naturally when you are in your 30s and 40s because at that phase ovulatory cycles are not regular anymore and you could be ovulating two follicles at the same time leading to a twin pregnancy. In vitro fertilisation (IVF) can increase the chance of twins, as more than one embryo may be transferred. After natural conception, about 1 in 80 births in the UK results in multiples, compared with 1 in 5 after IVF. How do I know I am carrying Twins? You may suspect you are having twins long before they are positively diagnosed. Extreme nausea can be one of the first symptoms and not being able to keep any food down. It’s as if you can tick all the boxes for early pregnancy symptoms but increase them tenfold. Smells are more acute, your bladder won’t seem to hold any reasonable volume of wee, you’re absolutely exhausted and your breasts may seem to have taken over your chest. This is because the pregnancy hormone, hCG is being produced in mega quantities and its effects on your body have become very evident. You are also likely to “show” much sooner than if you are only carrying one baby. It makes sense that two babies take up double the room. Pregnancy is usually not obvious until after the 12th week when the uterus starts lifting up out of the pelvis. But with twin pregnancies, a little round bulge is often visible long before the end of the first trimester. The other give away sign is lots of movements, felt earlier than normal. Quickening – which is the official term for foetal movements – isn’t generally felt until around 16 weeks by first-time mothers and as early as 14 weeks for those who’ve been pregnant before. But with twins, those tiny first movements can be very clear. Twins fill up the uterus much earlier than one baby and are in contact with the uterine wall as they bounce and flit around. You may also find out from having an ultrasound and see two babies on the screen. Sometimes pregnant mothers don’t know they’re having twins until the 18-week screening ultrasound; others as early as 12 weeks. It’s possible to see on ultrasound at 12 weeks or earlier which type of twins a woman is carrying. Unfortunately, identical twins are at a higher risk of having congenital abnormalities and complications, such as being small for gestation age. Fraternal twin pregnancies generally only require normal antenatal care but still need careful monitoring especially when the mother becomes very large and the risk of early delivery increases. Another way to detect a twin pregnancy is through Doppler; when two separate heartbeats are heard. What do I need during a twin pregnancy? You may need extra folic acid, 1 milligram of folic acid per day is recommended for twin pregnancies to reduce the risk of neural tube birth defects such as spina bifida. Prenatal vitamins are important, ensure that you get vital nutrients such as folic acid, iron, and calcium. You’ll be required to visit the clinic more often because you need to be monitored more frequently. Type of Twins There are two types of twins; fraternal twins and identical twins. Fraternal twins are formed from the fertilisation of two eggs by two different sperm. They are also known as ‘dizygotic twins’, or ‘non-identical twins’. With fraternal twins, the two foetuses (developing babies) each have a separate placenta, inner membrane (the amnion) and outer membrane (the chorion). They don’t usually look identical and might or might not be the same sex. Identical twins are formed from the splitting of one embryo. They are also known as ‘monozygotic twins’. There are different types of identical twins, depending on what they share in the womb. Almost one-third of identical twins have their own placenta, inner membrane, and outer membrane. The medical term for these twins is ‘dichorionic diamniotic’ or DCDA twins. Almost two-thirds of identical twins share the same placenta and chorion but have their own amnion. These are ‘monochorionic diamniotic’ or MCDA twins. The rest – only about 4% of identical twins – share everything, and are called ‘monochorionic monoamniotic’ (MCMA) twins. Twin-twin transfusion syndrome identical twins who share the same placenta and chorion can sometimes share a condition called twin–twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). In this condition, blood flows from one twin to the other, resulting in one baby getting too much blood and the other baby not getting enough. This affects the health of both babies, sometimes severely. Common twin pregnancy complications For the mother, Morning sickness which commonly extends to hyperemesis gravidarum (extreme vomiting). Gestational Diabetes. Pre-Eclampsia. Premature birth. If a mother can get to 38 weeks carrying a twin pregnancy she is doing very well. Caesarian section delivery – particularly if this is the mother’s first pregnancy and she has not laboured before. Bleeding/placenta praevia/placental abruption. For the baby, Smaller birth weight. Jaundice. Problems with feeding. A longer stay in the hospital after birth. Occasionally the babies have problems maintain their body temperature and stabilising their blood sugar levels. Infections and vulnerability due to their size. Breathing problems.`

Under the Nigerian Labour Law passed in 2004, a woman working in the country’s civil service has the right to maternity leave of three months, as long as she provides a medical certificate stating she should not or cannot work. The medical certificate allows her to stay off work for 12 weeks – six weeks before the birth of her baby and six weeks after. According to a report on Wednesday by The Punch newspaper, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, announced the extension to the leave Tuesday while addressing the plenary session at the ongoing 107th International Labour Conference in Geneva, Switzerland. “Nigeria recently increased the period for maternity leave from 12 to 16 weeks to allow enough recuperation time for both baby and mother in terms of breastfeeding,” Mr Ngige was quoted to have said at the conference themed: A future with decent work. He noted that disciplinary proceedings against any female member of staff during the period of her maternity leave shall be put in abeyance till the expiration of the leave. “Employers of labour are also barred from removal of women from work due to their marital status. “Illegal labour migration, contract staffing and labour casualisation which affects most women are being reformed through policies and regulations at national, bilateral and multilateral levels.” The minister also advised women to seek legal action against discrimination and abuses at workplace. “Women who fall victims to these abuses are encouraged to oppose such through legal actions as well as report to labour inspectors,’’ he said. He stressed the for appropriate legislation, policies and practices to deal with gender gaps which inhibit greater participation of women in the labour force. Female employees are entitled to maternity leave with full pay. However, the Nigerian Labour Act does not recognise paternity leave and makes no such provisions. A bill for an Act to make provisions for optional paternity leave to married male employees in private and public service failed to scale through second reading in the Nigerian House of Representatives last month. However, Lagos State civil servants are entitled to 10 days’ paternity leave within the first two months of the birth of a baby. As reported by Premium times newspaper.`

It's sometimes called pregnancy care or maternity care. You should start your antenatal care as soon as possible once you know you're pregnant. You can refer yourself for NHS pregnancy care so you can start your care with a midwife. This is usually done with an online form. If you cannot refer yourself online, the websites of local NHS trusts can tell you how to contact maternity services near you.

If you’re pregnant in England you will be offered: 2 pregnancy ultrasound scans at 11 to 14 weeks and 18 to 21 weeks, antenatal screening tests to find out the chance of your baby having certain conditions, such as Down's syndrome, blood tests to check for syphilis, HIV and hepatitis B, screening for sickle cell and thalassaemia. You may also be offered antenatal classes, including breastfeeding workshops. Ask your midwife about classes in your area. Starting antenatal care. You can refer yourself for NHS pregnancy care as soon as you know you're pregnant so you can start your care with a midwife. Your first midwife appointment should happen before you're 10 weeks pregnant where possible. You do not need to tell a GP you're pregnant unless you're taking medicine or have a long-term health condition. If you're registered with a GP, they'll be told about your pregnancy after your first midwife appointment. It's best to see a midwife or GP as early as possible to get the information you need about having a healthy pregnancy. Some tests, such as screening for sickle cell and thalassaemia, should be done before you're 10 weeks pregnant. If you're more than 10 weeks pregnant, you should still refer yourself for NHS pregnancy care as soon as possible. If you have special health needs, your midwife, GP or obstetrician may take shared responsibility for your maternity care. This means they'll all be involved in your care during pregnancy. Let your midwife know if you have a disability that means you have special requirements for your antenatal appointments or for labour. If you do not speak English, tell your midwife. How many antenatal appointments will I have? If you're expecting your first child, you'll have up to 10 antenatal appointments. If you have had a baby before, you'll have around 7 appointments, but sometimes you may have more – for example, if you develop a medical condition. Early in your pregnancy, your midwife or doctor will give you written information about how many appointments you're likely to have and when they'll happen. You should have a chance to discuss the schedule of antenatal appointments with them. If you cannot keep an appointment, let the clinic or midwife know and rearrange it. Where will I have my antenatal appointments? Your appointments can take place at: your home, a Children's Centre, a GP surgery, a hospital. You'll usually go to the hospital for your pregnancy scans. Antenatal appointments should take place in a setting where you feel able to discuss sensitive issues, such as domestic abuse, sexual abuse, mental health problems or drugs. To make sure you get the best pregnancy care, your midwife will ask you many questions about your and your family's health, and your preferences. Your midwife will carry out some antenatal checks and tests, some of which will be done throughout your pregnancy, such as urine tests and blood pressure checks. The results may affect your choices later in pregnancy, so it's important not to miss them. Your midwife will also ask about any other social care support you may have or need, such as support from social workers or family liaison officers. Questions you might be asked. The midwife or doctor might ask about: the date of the first day of your last period, your health, any previous illnesses and operations you have had, any previous pregnancies and miscarriages, the ethnic origins of you and your partner to find out whether your baby may be at risk of certain inherited conditions, whether your family has a history of twins, your job, your partner's job and what kind of accommodation you live in to see whether your circumstances might affect your pregnancy, how you're feeling and whether you have been depressed.

This could be because of domestic abuse or violence, sexual abuse or female genital mutilation. Antenatal appointments after 24 weeks. From around 24 weeks of your pregnancy, your antenatal appointments will usually become more frequent. But if your pregnancy is uncomplicated and you're in good health, you may not be seen as often as someone who needs to be more closely monitored. Later visits are usually quite short and may last 20 to 30 minutes. Your midwife or doctor will: check your urine and blood pressure, feel your tummy (abdomen) to check the baby's position, measure your womb (uterus) to check your baby's growth, listen to your baby's heartbeat, if you want them to. You can also ask questions or talk about anything that's worrying you. Talking about your feelings is as important as all the antenatal tests and examinations. You should be given information about: making your birth plan, preparing for labour and birth, how to tell if you're in active labour, induction of labour if your baby is overdue (after your expected date of delivery), feeling depressed after childbirth – such as the "baby blues" and postnatal depression, feeding your baby, vitamin K (given to prevent vitamin K deficiency bleeding in your baby), screening tests for newborn babies, looking after yourself and your new baby. Find out about your schedule of antenatal appointments and what to expect at each one. At each antenatal appointment from 24 weeks of pregnancy, your midwife or doctor will check your baby's growth. To do this, they'll measure the distance from the top of your womb to your pubic bone. The measurement will be recorded in your notes. Your baby's movements. Keep track of your baby's movements. If you have not felt any movement by the time you are 24 weeks pregnant, contact your midwife who will check your baby’s heartbeat. After 24 weeks, if your baby’s movements become less frequent, slow down or stop (called reduced foetal movement), contact your midwife or doctor immediately – do not wait until the next day. Your midwife or doctor will check you and your baby and measure your bump. You'll be offered an ultrasound scan if they have any concerns about how your baby is growing and developing. Find out more about your baby's movements in pregnancy. Your maternity notes. At your booking appointment, your midwife will record your details and add to them at each appointment. These are your maternity notes. Your maternity notes may be in a record book, sometimes called handheld notes. You’ll take your maternity notes home and be asked to bring them to all your antenatal appointments. Take your notes with you wherever you go in case you need medical attention while you’re away from home. Your maternity notes may be electronic, which you will be able to access digitally. You can ask your maternity team to explain anything in your notes that you do not understand. Planning ahead for your appointments. Waiting times in clinics can vary and having to wait a long time for an appointment can be particularly difficult if you have young children with you. Planning ahead can make your visits easier. Here are some suggestions: write a list of any questions you want to ask and take it with you, make sure you get answers to your questions or the chance to discuss any worries, if your partner is free, they may be able to go with you – this can help them feel more involved in the pregnancy, you can buy refreshments in some clinics – take a snack with you if you cannot buy one at the clinic. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) antenatal care guidelines give useful information on the timing of visits during pregnancy and a description of what will happen each time.`

    content: `Ultrasound scans use sound waves to build a picture of the baby in the womb. The scans are painless, have no known side effects on mothers or babies, and can be carried out at any stage of pregnancy. Talk to your midwife, GP or obstetrician about any concerns you have. Having a scan in pregnancy is usually a happy event, but be aware that ultrasound scans may detect some serious health conditions. It's your choice whether to have screening. Your midwife can discuss your options with you. See If antenatal screening tests find something for more information on if a scan or other screening test suggests your baby may be more likely to have a condition. What will happen at the scan? Most scans are carried out by sonographers. The scan is carried out in a dimly lit room so the sonographer is able to get good images of your baby. You'll be asked to lie on your back and reveal your tummy. The sonographer will put ultrasound gel on your tummy, which makes sure there is good contact between the machine and your skin. The sonographer passes a probe over your tummy and a picture of the baby will appear on the ultrasound screen. During the exam, sonographers need to keep the screen in a position that gives them a good view of the baby. The sonographer will carefully examine your baby's body. The sonographer may need to apply slight pressure on your tummy to get the best views of the baby. How long will a scan take? A scan usually takes around 20 to 30 minutes. However, the sonographer may not be able to get good views if your baby is lying in an awkward position or moving around a lot. If it's difficult to get a good image, the scan may take longer or have to be repeated at another time. Can an ultrasound scan harm me or my baby? There are no known risks to the baby or the mother from having an ultrasound scan, but it's important that you consider carefully whether to have the scan or not. This is because the scan can provide information that may mean you have to make further important decisions. For example, you may be offered further tests, such as amniocentesis, that have a risk of miscarriage. When are scans offered? Hospitals in England offer at least 2 ultrasound scans during pregnancy: at 11 to 14 weeks and between 18 and 21 weeks. The first scan is called the 12-week scan. The sonographer estimates when your baby is due (the estimated date of delivery, or EDD) based on the baby's measurements. The dating scan can include a nuchal translucency (NT) scan, which is part of the combined screening test for Down's syndrome, if you choose to have this screening. The second scan offered during pregnancy is the 20-week screening scan. It usually takes place between 18 and 21 weeks of pregnancy. It's sometimes called the anomaly scan or mid-pregnancy scan. This scan checks for 11 physical conditions in your baby. You may be offered more than 2 scans, depending on your health and the pregnancy. When will I get the results? The sonographer will be able to tell you the results of the scan at the time. Do I have to have ultrasound scans? No, not if you do not want to. Some people want to find out if their baby is more likely to have a condition, while others do not. The 12-week dating scan and 20-week screening scan will be offered to you, but you do not have to have them. Your choice will be respected if you decide not to have the scans, and your antenatal care will continue as normal. You'll be given the chance to discuss it with your maternity team before making your decision. What can an ultrasound scan be used for? An ultrasound scan can be used to: check your baby's size – at the 12-week dating scan, this gives a better idea of how many weeks pregnant you are; your due date, which is originally calculated from the first day of your last period, may be adjusted according to the ultrasound measurements, check whether you're having more than 1 baby, detect some physical conditions, show the position of your baby and the placenta – for example, when the placenta is low down in late pregnancy, a caesarean section may be advised, check that the baby is growing normally – this is particularly important if you're carrying twins, or you've had problems in this pregnancy or a previous pregnancy. Can I bring family or friends with me when I have the scan? Yes. You may like someone to come with you to the scan appointment. Most hospitals do not allow children to attend scans as childcare is not usually available. Please ask your hospital about this before your appointment. Remember, an ultrasound scan is an important medical examination and it is treated in the same way as any other hospital investigation. Ultrasound scans can sometimes find problems with the baby. If everything appears normal, what happens next? Most scans show that the baby is developing normally and no problems are found. This is because most babies are healthy. You can continue with your routine antenatal care. Scans cannot pick up all health conditions so it's important to speak to a doctor or midwife if you're worried that something is not right. If the scan shows your baby is more likely to have a condition, what happens next? If the scan shows your baby is more likely to have a condition, the sonographer may ask for a second opinion from another member of staff. You might be offered another test to find out for certain if your baby has the condition. If you're offered further tests, you will be given more information about them so you can decide whether or not you want to have them. You'll be able to discuss this with your midwife or consultant. If necessary, you will be referred to a specialist, possibly in another hospital. Can I find out the sex of my baby? Finding out the sex of your baby is not offered as part of the national screening programme. If you want to find out the sex of your baby, you may be able to during the 20-week screening scan but this depends on the policy of your hospital. Tell the sonographer at the start of the scan that you'd like to know your baby's sex. Be aware, though, that it's not possible for the sonographer to be 100% certain about your baby's sex. For example, if your baby is lying in an awkward position, it may be difficult or impossible to tell. Some hospitals have a policy of not telling patients the sex of their baby. Speak to your sonographer or midwife to find out more. Can I have a picture of my baby? You will need to check if your hospital provides this service. If they do, there may be a charge.`

    region: "UK",
    content: `A healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle at any time but is especially vital if you're pregnant or planning a pregnancy. Eating healthily during pregnancy will help your baby to develop and grow. You do not need to go on a special diet, but it's important to eat a variety of different foods every day to get the right balance of nutrients that you and your baby need. It's best to get vitamins and minerals from the foods you eat, but when you're pregnant you need to take a folic acid supplement as well, to make sure you get everything you need. Read more about vitamins and supplements in pregnancy. There are also certain foods that should be avoided in pregnancy. There's no need to "eat for 2". You will probably find that you are more hungry than usual, but you do not need to "eat for 2" – even if you are expecting twins or triplets. Try to have a healthy breakfast every day, because this can help you to avoid snacking on foods that are high in fat and sugar. Eating healthily often means changing the amounts of different foods you eat, so that your diet is varied, rather than cutting out all your favourites. You can use the Eatwell Guide to get the balance of your diet right. It shows you how much of what you eat should come from each food group to achieve a healthy, balanced diet. You do not need to achieve this balance with every meal, but try to get the balance right over a week. Fruit and vegetables in pregnancy. Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables because these provide vitamins and minerals, as well as fibre, which helps digestion and can help prevent constipation. Eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day – these can include fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced. Always wash fresh fruit and vegetables carefully. Find out what counts as a portion of fruit or vegetables. Starchy foods (carbohydrates) in pregnancy. Starchy foods are an important source of energy, some vitamins and fibre, and help you to feel full without containing too many calories. They include bread, potatoes, breakfast cereals, rice, pasta, noodles, maize, millet, oats, yams and cornmeal. If you are having chips, go for oven chips lower in fat and salt. These foods should make up just over a 3rd of the food you eat. Instead of refined starchy (white) food, choose wholegrain or higher-fibre options such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice or simply leaving the skins on potatoes. Protein in pregnancy. Eat some protein-rich foods every day. Sources of protein include: beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat (but avoid liver), poultry, nuts. Choose lean meat, remove the skin from poultry, and try not to add extra fat or oil when cooking meat. Read more about eating meat in a healthy way. Make sure poultry, burgers, sausages and whole cuts of meat such as lamb, beef and pork are cooked very thoroughly until steaming all the way through. Check that there is no pink meat, and that juices have no pink or red in them. Try to eat 2 portions of fish each week, 1 of which should be oily fish such as salmon, sardines or mackerel. Find out about the health benefits of fish and shellfish. There are some types of fish you should avoid when you're pregnant or planning to get pregnant, including shark, swordfish and marlin. When you're pregnant, you should avoid having more than 2 portions of oily fish a week, such as salmon, trout, mackerel and herring, because it can contain pollutants (toxins). You should avoid eating some raw or partially cooked eggs, as there is a risk of salmonella. Eggs produced under the British Lion Code of Practice are safe for pregnant women to eat raw or partially cooked, as they come from flocks that have been vaccinated against salmonella. These eggs have a red lion logo stamped on their shell. Pregnant women can eat these raw or partially cooked (for example, soft boiled eggs). Eggs that have not been produced under the Lion Code are considered less safe, and pregnant women are advised to avoid eating them raw or partially cooked, including in mousse, mayonnaise and soufflé. These eggs should be cooked until the white and the yolk are hard. Find out more about foods to avoid in pregnancy. Dairy in pregnancy. Dairy foods such as milk, cheese, fromage frais and yoghurt are important in pregnancy because they contain calcium and other nutrients that you and your baby need. Choose low-fat varieties wherever possible, such as semi-skimmed, 1 percent fat or skimmed milk, low-fat and lower-sugar yoghurt and reduced-fat hard cheese. If you prefer dairy alternatives, such as soya drinks and yoghurts, go for unsweetened, calcium-fortified versions. Find out more about dairy and dairy alternatives. There are some cheeses you should avoid in pregnancy, including unpasteurised cheeses. To find out which cheeses you should not eat when you're pregnant on our page about foods to avoid in pregnancy. Foods that are high in fat, sugar or both. Sugary foods and drinks are often high in calories, which can contribute to weight gain. Having sugary foods and drinks can also lead to tooth decay. Fat is very high in calories, so eating too many fatty foods, or eating them too often, can make you put on weight. Eating too much saturated fat can also increase the amount of cholesterol in your blood, which increases your chance of developing heart disease. Foods that are high in fat, sugar, or both, include: all spreading fats (such as butter), oils, salad dressings, cream, chocolate, crisps, biscuits, pastries, ice cream, cake, puddings, fizzy drinks. If you're having foods and drinks that are high in fat and sugar, have these less often and in small amounts. Try to cut down on saturated fat, and have small amounts of foods rich in unsaturated fat instead, such as vegetable oils. Find out about saturated and unsaturated fat. Healthy snacks in pregnancy. If you get hungry between meals, try not to eat snacks that are high in fat and/or sugar, such as sweets, biscuits, crisps or chocolate. Instead, choose something healthier, such as: small sandwiches or pitta bread with grated cheese, lean ham, mashed tuna, salmon, or sardines, with salad; salad vegetables, such as carrot, celery or cucumber; low-fat, lower-sugar fruit yoghurt, plain yoghurt or fromage frais with fruit; ready-to-eat apricots, figs or prunes; vegetable and bean soups; a small bowl of unsweetened breakfast cereal, or porridge, with milk; milky drinks; fresh fruit; baked beans on toast or a small baked potato; a small slice of malt loaf, a fruited tea cake or a slice of toasted fruit bread. When choosing snacks, you can use food labels to help you. Find out more about food labelling, including how the "green, amber, red" code can help you make healthier choices quickly. Preparing food safely. Wash fruit, vegetables and salads to remove all traces of soil, which may contain toxoplasma (a parasite that can cause toxoplasmosis) which can harm your unborn baby. Wash all surfaces and utensils, and your hands, after preparing raw foods (poultry, meat, eggs, fish, shellfish and raw vegetables) to help you avoid food poisoning. Make sure that raw foods are stored separately from ready-to-eat foods, otherwise there's a risk of contamination. Use a separate knife and chopping board for raw meats. Heat ready meals until they're steaming hot all the way through – this is especially important for meals containing poultry. Check the use-by date to make sure food is safe to eat – do not eat food after the use-by date even if it looks and smells ok. You also need to make sure that some foods, such as eggs, poultry, burgers, sausages and whole cuts of meat like lamb, beef and pork, are cooked very thoroughly until steaming all the way through.`

    category: "Vegetarian or Vegan Diet",
    region: "UK",
    content: `Eating healthily during pregnancy is important for your own health and the health of your developing baby. It's important to eat a varied and balanced diet during pregnancy to provide enough nutrients for you and the development and growth of your baby. If you're pregnant and a vegetarian or vegan, you need to make sure you get enough iron and vitamin B12, which are mainly found in meat and fish, and vitamin D, calcium and iodine. Iron in your diet. Good sources of iron for vegetarians and vegans include: pulses, dark green vegetables, wholemeal bread and flour, nuts, fortified breakfast cereals (with added iron), dried fruit, such as apricots. Vitamin B12 in your diet. Good sources of vitamin B12 for vegetarians include milk, cheese and eggs. Good sources for vegans include: breakfast cereals fortified with vitamin B12, unsweetened soya drinks fortified with vitamin B12, yeast extract, such as Marmite, and nutritional yeast flakes which are fortified with vitamin B12. Vitamin D in your diet. From late March or early April until the end of September, most people should be able to get enough vitamin D from sunlight. Although we get vitamin D from sunlight, vegetarian food sources include: egg yolk, foods fortified with vitamin D, including some breakfast cereals and fat spreads, dietary supplements. Because vitamin D is found only in a small number of foods, it is difficult to get enough from foods that naturally contain vitamin D and fortified foods alone. That's why the government recommends that all adults, including those who are pregnant and breastfeeding, should consider taking a daily supplement containing 10 micrograms of vitamin D during the winter months (October until the end of March). You may be at particular risk of not having enough vitamin D if: you have brown or black skin (for example, if you're of African, African Caribbean or south Asian origin), you cover your skin when outside or spend lots of time indoors. You may need to consider taking a daily supplement of vitamin D all year. Talk to a midwife or doctor for advice. If you're vegan, check the label to make sure your vitamin D is suitable for vegans. Calcium in your diet. If you're a vegan, you also need to make sure you get enough calcium. This is because non-vegans get most of their calcium from dairy foods. Good sources of calcium for vegans include: dark green leafy vegetables, pulses, fortified unsweetened soya, pea and oat drinks, brown and white bread, calcium-set tofu, sesame seeds and tahini, dried fruit. Talk to your midwife or doctor about how you can get all the nutrients you need for you and your baby. Iodine in your diet. Good sources of iodine for vegetarians include cow's milk, dairy products and eggs. Iodine can also be found in plant foods, such as cereals and grains, but the levels vary depending on the amount of iodine in the soil where the plants are grown. If you're vegan then you may want to consider taking an iodine supplement or eating foods fortified with iodine, such as some types of plant-based drinks.`

    category: "Foods to Avoid",
    region: "UK",
    content: `Most foods and drinks are safe to have during pregnancy. But there are some things you should be careful with or avoid. Cheese, milk and other dairy. What you can eat: pasteurised milk, yoghurt, cream and ice cream; pasteurised or unpasteurised hard cheeses, such as cheddar, gruyere and parmesan; pasteurised semi-hard cheeses, such as edam; pasteurised soft cheeses, such as cottage cheese, mozzarella, feta, cream cheese, paneer, ricotta, halloumi, goats' cheese without a white coating on the outside (rind) and processed cheese spreads; soft or blue cheese (pasteurised or unpasteurised) that has been cooked until steaming hot. What to avoid: any other foods made from unpasteurised milk, such as soft ripened goats' cheese; pasteurised or unpasteurised mould-ripened soft cheeses with a white coating on the outside, such as brie, camembert and chèvre (unless cooked until steaming hot); pasteurised or unpasteurised soft blue cheeses, such as danish blue, gorgonzola and roquefort (unless cooked until steaming hot); unpasteurised cows' milk, goats' milk, sheep's milk or cream. Why: There's a small chance that unpasteurised or soft ripened dairy products may contain Listeria bacteria. This can cause an infection called listeriosis. Listeriosis can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth, or make your newborn baby very unwell. Soft cheeses with a white coating on the outside have more moisture. This can make it easier for bacteria to grow. Cooking cheese until it's steaming hot kills bacteria, reducing the risk of listeriosis. Meat and poultry. What you can eat: meats such as chicken, pork and beef, as long as they're well-cooked with no trace of pink or blood; be especially careful with poultry, pork, sausages and burgers; cold, pre-packed meats such as ham and corned beef. What to be careful with: cold cured meats, such as salami, pepperoni, chorizo and prosciutto (unless cooked thoroughly). What to avoid: raw or undercooked meat; liver and liver products; all types of pâté, including vegetarian pâté; game meats such as goose, partridge or pheasant. Why: There's a small risk of getting toxoplasmosis if you eat raw and undercooked meat, which can cause miscarriage. Cured meats are not cooked, so they may have parasites in them that cause toxoplasmosis. Liver and liver products have lots of vitamin A in them. This can be harmful to an unborn baby. Game meats may contain lead shot. Eggs. What you can eat: raw, partially cooked and fully cooked British Lion hen eggs (they have a lion stamp on them) and hen eggs produced under the Laid in Britain scheme; foods made with raw hen egg, such as mousse and mayonnaise, if made with British Lion eggs or hen eggs produced under the Laid in Britain scheme; well cooked eggs (white and yolk) from any hen eggs that are not British Lion eggs or produced under the Laid in Britain scheme; well cooked eggs (white and yolk) of all other eggs, including duck, goose or quail. What to avoid: raw or partially cooked hen eggs that are not British Lion or produced under the Laid in Britain scheme; raw or partially cooked duck, goose or quail eggs. Why: British Lion hen eggs and hen eggs produced under the Laid in Britain scheme are less likely to have salmonella in them. Salmonella is unlikely to harm your unborn baby, but you could get food poisoning. You should cook all eggs thoroughly, unless they are British Lion hen eggs or hen eggs produced under the Laid in Britain scheme. Fish. What you can eat: cooked fish and seafood; sushi, as long as the fish has been cooked thoroughly; cooked shellfish, such as mussels, lobster, crab, prawns, scallops and clams. What to limit: you should eat no more than 2 portions of oily fish a week, such as salmon, trout, mackerel or herring; you should eat no more than 2 tuna steaks (about 140g cooked or 170g raw) or 4 medium-size cans of tuna (about 140g when drained) per week. Information: Tuna does not count as an oily fish. You can have 2 tuna steaks, or 4 medium-size cans of fish, as well as 2 portions of oily fish a week. What to avoid: swordfish; marlin; shark; raw shellfish; cold-smoked or cured fish (for example smoked salmon or gravlax, including in sushi), unless it has been cooked until steaming hot. Why: You should avoid ready-to-eat cold-smoked or cured fish because it could be contaminated with listeria bacteria. These bacteria can cause an infection called listeriosis, which can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth, or make your newborn baby seriously ill. Cooking smoked or cured fish until it's steaming hot will kill any bacteria that may be present. You should limit tuna because it has more mercury in it than other fish. If you eat too much mercury, it can be harmful to your unborn baby. You should limit oily fish because they can have pollutants such as dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls in them. If you eat too much of these, they can be harmful to your unborn baby. You should avoid raw shellfish because they can have harmful bacteria, viruses or toxins in them. These can make you unwell and give you food poisoning. Other foods and drinks. Caffeine. You can have caffeine, but no more than 200mg per day. Regularly drinking more than this amount can increase your risk of pregnancy complications, such as low birthweight, and even miscarriage. There is: 100mg in a mug of instant coffee; 140mg in a mug of filter coffee; 75mg in a mug of tea (green tea can have the same amount of caffeine as regular tea); 40mg in a can of cola; 80mg in a 250ml can of energy drink; less than 25mg in a 50g bar of plain dark chocolate; less than 10mg in a 50g bar of plain milk chocolate. Herbal teas. The caffeine content can vary quite widely between different brands of herbal tea. Some contain no caffeine, while others may have quite high levels. Check the ingredients label on the packet to see how much caffeine is in a brand. Some of the herbs used in herbal tea can also be potentially dangerous if you have a lot of them during pregnancy; especially during weeks 1 to 12 (first trimester). As a general rule, if you drink no more than 1 to 2 cups of herbal tea a day during your pregnancy, you should be fine. Alcohol. Drinking alcohol in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to your baby. If you're pregnant or planning to get pregnant, the safest approach is to not drink alcohol at all. This keeps risks to your baby to a minimum. Liquorice. Liquorice is safe to eat. But you should avoid liquorice root. Fruits, vegetables and salads. Be careful with fruits, vegetables and salads as they can have soil on them, which can make you unwell. Make sure to thoroughly wash all fruits, vegetables and salad ingredients. Enoki mushrooms. There's a chance that enoki mushrooms may contain Listeria bacteria. This can cause an infection called listeriosis. Listeriosis can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth, or make your newborn baby very unwell. Cooking enoki mushrooms thoroughly kills bacteria, reducing the risk of listeriosis. Enoki mushrooms should be stored in the fridge before use. When preparing enoki mushrooms, wash your hands regularly with soap and warm water, and clean any surfaces and utensils used. Peanuts. You do not need to avoid eating peanuts when you're pregnant. Only avoid eating peanuts if you're advised to by a healthcare professional, or if you have a nut allergy. Vitamins. Do not take high-dose multivitamin supplements, or any supplements with vitamin A in them.`

    content: `Eating a healthy, varied diet in pregnancy will help you get most of the vitamins and minerals you need. But when you're pregnant, or there's a chance you might get pregnant, it's important to also take a folic acid supplement. It's recommended that you take: 400 micrograms of folic acid every day – from before you're pregnant until you're 12 weeks pregnant. This is to reduce the risk of problems in the baby's development in the early weeks of pregnancy. It is also recommended that you take a daily vitamin D supplement. Do not take cod liver oil or any supplements containing vitamin A (retinol) when you're pregnant. Too much vitamin A could harm your baby. Always check the label. You also need to know which foods to avoid in pregnancy. Where to get pregnancy supplements. You can get supplements from pharmacies and supermarkets, or a GP may be able to prescribe them for you. If you want to get your folic acid from a multivitamin tablet, make sure the tablet does not contain vitamin A (or retinol). You may be able to get free vitamins if you qualify for the Healthy Start scheme. Find out more about the Healthy Start scheme. Folic acid before and during pregnancy. It's important to take a 400 micrograms folic acid tablet every day before you're pregnant and until you're 12 weeks pregnant. Folic acid can help prevent birth defects known as neural tube defects, including spina bifida. If you did not take folic acid before you conceived, you should start as soon as you find out you're pregnant. Try to eat green leafy vegetables which contain folate (the natural form of folic acid) and breakfast cereals and fat spreads with folic acid added to them. It's difficult to get the amount of folate recommended for a healthy pregnancy from food alone, which is why it's important to take a folic acid supplement. Higher-dose folic acid. If you have a higher chance of your pregnancy being affected by neural tube defects, you will be advised to take a higher dose of folic acid (5 milligrams). You will be advised to take this each day until you're 12 weeks pregnant. You may have a higher chance if: you or the baby's biological father have a neural tube defect; you or the baby's biological father have a family history of neural tube defects; you have had a previous pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect; you have diabetes; you take anti-epilepsy medicine; you take anti-retroviral medicine for HIV. If any of this applies to you, talk to a GP. They can prescribe a higher dose of folic acid. A GP or midwife may also recommend additional screening tests during your pregnancy. Find out about epilepsy and pregnancy. Vitamin D in pregnancy. You need 10 micrograms of vitamin D each day. It's recommended pregnant and breastfeeding women take a daily supplement containing this amount between September and March. Vitamin D regulates the amount of calcium and phosphate in the body, which are needed to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy. Our bodies make vitamin D when our skin is exposed to summer sunlight (from late March/early April to the end of September). Between the months of September and March the body cannot make sufficient vitamin D from sunlight alone, which is why a supplement is recommended. Vitamin D is also in some foods, including: oily fish (such as salmon, mackerel, herring and sardines) – during pregnancy, you should eat no more than 2 portions of oily fish a week; egg yolks; red meat; fortified foods – such as some fat spreads and breakfast cereals; liver – but avoid eating liver during pregnancy. Because vitamin D is only found in a small number of foods, whether naturally occurring or added, it is difficult to get enough from foods alone. Do not take more than 100 micrograms (4,000 IU) of vitamin D a day as it could be harmful. You can get vitamin supplements containing vitamin D free of charge if you're pregnant or breastfeeding and qualify for the Healthy Start scheme. Information: There have been some reports about vitamin D reducing the risk of coronavirus (COVID-19). But there is currently not enough evidence to support taking vitamin D solely to prevent or treat COVID-19. If you have dark skin or cover your skin a lot. You may be at particular risk of not having enough vitamin D if: you have dark skin (for example, if you're of African, African Caribbean or south Asian origin); you cover your skin when outside or spend lots of time indoors. You may need to consider taking a daily supplement of vitamin D all year. Talk to a midwife or doctor for advice. Iron in pregnancy. If you do not have enough iron, you'll probably get very tired and may suffer from anaemia. Lean meat, green leafy vegetables, dried fruit and nuts contain iron. If you'd like to eat peanuts or foods that contain peanuts (such as peanut butter) during pregnancy, you can do so as part of a healthy, balanced diet unless you're allergic to them or your health professional advises you not to. Many breakfast cereals have iron added to them. If the iron level in your blood becomes low, a GP or midwife will advise you to take iron supplements. Vitamin C in pregnancy. Vitamin C protects cells and helps keep them healthy. It's found in a wide variety of fruit and vegetables, and a balanced diet can provide all the vitamin C you need. Good sources include: oranges and orange juice; red and green peppers; strawberries; blackcurrants; broccoli; brussels sprouts; potatoes. Calcium in pregnancy. Calcium is vital for making your baby's bones and teeth. Sources of calcium include: milk, cheese and yoghurt; green leafy vegetables, such as rocket, watercress or curly kale; tofu; soya drinks with added calcium; bread and any foods made with fortified flour; fish where you eat the bones, such as sardines and pilchards. Vegetarian, vegan and special diets in pregnancy. A varied and balanced vegetarian diet should provide enough nutrients for you and your baby during pregnancy. But you might find it more difficult to get enough iron and vitamin B12. Talk to a midwife or doctor about how to make sure you're getting enough of these important nutrients. If you're vegan or you follow a restricted diet because of a food intolerance (for example, a gluten-free diet for coeliac disease) or for religious reasons, talk to a midwife or GP. Ask to be referred to a dietitian for advice on how to make sure you're getting all the nutrients you need for you and your baby. Find out more about healthy eating if you're pregnant and vegetarian or vegan. Healthy Start vitamins. The Healthy Start scheme may be able to help you buy food and milk if you're pregnant or have a child under 4 years old and receive certain benefits, or you’re pregnant and under 18. If you're eligible, you'll be sent a Healthy Start card which you can use to buy certain types of milk, infant formula, fruit and vegetables. You can also use your card to get free vitamins. If you're not eligible for the Healthy Start scheme, some NHS organisations still offer the vitamins for free, or sell them. Ask a midwife about what's available in your area.`
